## ❓ Why? [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
The goal of this project was to learn the basics of ReactJS. This project was a big project : a anime watchlist application. 
In this page, we can :
- Search for every anime
- Read the synopsis of every anime
- Have all informations (Rank, Score of the community, Popularity, etc...)
- Add/Remove an anime from the WatchList

## ✨ Tech stack [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
For this project, I used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for default package management for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment from Node.js and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) the open-source JavaScript library used to facilitate the creation of single-page web applications, via the creation of components that depend on a state and generate an HTML page at each state change..


## 💾 Install [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

Project setup
```
cd anime-watchlist
npm install

## 🎛️ API [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
I use the API called [Jikan  API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/). It's a free and opensource API used by [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
